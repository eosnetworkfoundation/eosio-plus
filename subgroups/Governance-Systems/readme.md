# Home of the EOSIO+ Governance Systems subgroup

Working on the following objective:
- A description of the functional governance system for ongoing decision making.
  - Who are the members that can vote?
    - One vote per "engaged" BP?  Engaged means they attend meetings.  This is instead of "All BPs" which would make voting / ranking next to impossible.
    - Obe vote per "engaged" Chain?  Again as above - attending meetings and helping drive the process.
    - Weighting by Chain? (Likely unecessary for early work as we have a huge backlog and consensus should likely guide us.)
  - How are new members added or removed?
  - How is voting or ranking accomplished [(see Software Development Group 2nd item)](../SoftwareDevelopment/objectives.md)
  - How are new proposals added, discussed, and prioritzed by the group (again see the SW Dev group issues)
  - Other questions we should tackle as part of this?
