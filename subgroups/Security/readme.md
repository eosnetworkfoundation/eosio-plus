EOSIO Security process
======================

Whenever a vulnerability is found in the core software, it must be communicated descretely to a corresponding engineering group.

A private Telegram chat includes network operators on major EOSIO blockchains, and all 
mitigation measures are first communicated there. Most participants keep it unmuted, so only highly 
important discussions belong in there.

A mitigation patch is usually not published until all operators ensure that it is applied on most critical infrastructure.

A security fix release is published soon afterwards.
